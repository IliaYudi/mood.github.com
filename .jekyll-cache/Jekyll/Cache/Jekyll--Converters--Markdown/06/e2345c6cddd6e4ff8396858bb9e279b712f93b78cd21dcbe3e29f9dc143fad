<hr />
<p>Many programmers, as well as people who have one or another attitude to working with a computer, don’t understand what Unicode, encodings means, which, doesn’t prevent them from using (and sometimes not so) successfully.
We will try to understand these concepts as simply as possible and find out how Unicode works.</p>

<p>In fact, every person in the modern world interacting with the Internet constantly uses the product of the intellectual work of the three brilliant founders of the Unicode standard. Already in 1987, work began on the creation of Unicode architecture using three people: Lee Collins, Joe Becker and Mark Davis.</p>

<p>So what did these three people give us, and why did Unicode become so popular?</p>

<p>Unicode is a generally accepted worldwide coding standard, from alphabet letters to mathematical symbols.
The question arises, why should symbols, letters, emoticons, signs be encoded, can they really not be used as is?
The computer only accepts bits and bytes, for it there are no letters or punctuation marks in the form in which we are accustomed to perceive them. Therefore, we see the letter or symbol in the e-mail or program in decrypted form, they are transmitted and stored in encoded form.
Encoding is a way of storing the information you want to convey.
For example, the English letter <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>, is transmitted as <code class="highlighter-rouge">0100 0001</code>. This letter weighs exactly one byte and consists, as you see, of 8 bits.
But most often we see encoded letters in the hexadecimal notation (HEX), where alphabetic values are used, in addition to numbers:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try to encode the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">Documentat.io</code> in ASCII encoding using the table:</p>

<p><img src="/hagura/images/askii.jpg" alt="sample post" /></p>

<p>Our word will look like:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>44 6F 63 75 6D 65 6E 74 61 74 2E 69 6F
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>When the computer reads the information, that you want to transfer, it must understand what encoding you used, otherwise you will encounter the fact that you will see characters that aren’t translated into a normal language, the so-called “mojibake”.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ЊСЃСЏ. R’РѕС ‚СЃРєРѕР» СЊРєРѕ РѕРЅР
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Surely you have met such symbols more than once.
Surely you have met such symbols more than once.</p>
<h2 id="several-problems-and-one-solution">Several problems and one solution.</h2>
<hr />
<p>In those days when there was no Internet, different countries came up with their own encodings. For many systems and computers in Western countries, the ASCII “American Standard Code for Information Interchange” encoding was widely used. In the days before Unicode it was the standard. Japan, the USSR and other countries developed their own unique encodings. That is why there is a great variety of them now.</p>

<p>All this “worked”, but in order to read a letter from Japan, for example, you had to install the encoding on the computer in which the letter was written, and there is no guarantee that the system will be able to support it. The solution was and people used faxes

<p>But the era of the world wide web was approaching, and this carried a number of problems that required a concise and universal solution.
Let’s formulate these problems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Versatility. *
The standard must have included many alphabets and symbols adopted in different countries of the world. And due to the many encoded characters there is a problem number 2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Storage. *
To encode a large number of letters and characters, the code space must be large.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Compatibility. *
The new standard should support the old ASCII coding, while not only supporting, but coding identically, for legacy systems to work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Zeros. *
The encoded character should not have 8 zeros in a row, this is due to the fact that numerous outdated systems perceived this as the end of the transmission and stopped the further process of reading data. For them, the line ended.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
